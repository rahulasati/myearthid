# EarthId Client Side Integration

## Setup developer API credentials
  1. Contact us on future@myearth.id
  2. Register yourself as vendor with [MyEarthId](https://www.myearth.id)
  3. We will generate apiKey and secretKey of the respective app.
  4. These credentials are important for initializing our sdk. The example for the same is given below.

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Include earthId.js file within your code

### Step 2: Generate QR code
function to creates a QR code image link for login with earthId or for document.

```
const qrCodeLink = await generateQrCode();
```

#### Parameters

-   `type` **[string]** this is optional, supported values are **login** (to get profile information) or **document** if documents are also required from earthId app.
- `socketId` **[string]** this is optional, only required if you want to listen data using socket.

#### Response
Returns **[string]** response web URL string of QR code generated which needs to display as image

### Step 3: Display generated QR code link as image within your application
```
<img id="qrCode" src={qrCodeLink} style={{ width: 150, height: 150 }} />
```

### Step 4: Open EarthId Mobile App to scan the QR code

### Step 5: You will see authorization popup in EarthId App to authorize or deny the request to share your profile data

### Step 6: You will get user data on registered webhook

#### verifyGatewaySignature 

There are a few HTTP headers that are useful for your application when consuming the webhook request. x-request-type lets your app know, response is for login or document. x-request-signature-sha256 contains a HMAC SHA256 hash based on the webhook payload and a key which is your app secret key. The webhook signature should be validated prior to parsing the webhook payload.

#### Parameters
-   `req` **[object]** req object of postback URL received

#### Response
Returns **[boolean]** signature is valid or not.


### Step 7 (optional): Connect to EarthId socket URL and Listen for user data

```
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socketUrl = "https://socket.myearthid.ml";

let socket = await io.connect(socketUrl);
socket.on('connect', () => {
    //lisetn for user data
    socket.on(`userdata`, async data => {
      if(data.newreq && data.newreq.permission == 'granted') {
        let userData = data.newreq;
      } else { //denied
        //show alert or similar to notify user has denied the request.
      }
      disconnectSocket();     
    });
    resolve(socket.id)
})
```

#### User approved authorization
```
{
    "permission": "granted",
    "fname": "Rahul Asati",
    "userEmail": "rahul@rejolut.com",
    "userMobileNo": "+918512806087",
    "dob": "",
    "emailVerified": true,
    "score": 450,
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "mobileVerified": true,
    "duration": "86400000",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
    "documents": ["",""] //if requestType is document and user has authorized to share
}
```
#### User denied authorization
```
{
    "permission": "denied"
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
}
```
